## Technical Details:

This stock exchange platform is built using the Flask framework, a lightweight and flexible web framework that makes it easy to build dynamic web applications in Python. 

The platform uses SQLite3 for the database, a lightweight and reliable database that is well-suited for small to medium-sized web applications.

The HTML templates define the structure of the pages in the application, while the CSS stylesheet defines the visual appearance of the pages. 

The Flask application uses the Jinja2 template engine to render the HTML templates and apply the CSS styles, resulting in a dynamic and visually appealing user interface.
